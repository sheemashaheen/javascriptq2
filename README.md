## How does type coercion work in JavaScript?


- Type coercion in JavaScript refers to the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another.
- JavaScript is a loosely typed language, which means that variables are not bound to a specific data type, and type coercion can occur implicitly during operations or comparisons.

There are two types of type coercion in JavaScript: 
- Explicit
  ---
- Implicit
    ---
  ### Explicit Type Coercion:
This occurs when you intentionally convert a value from one type to another using functions or methods.

  For example:

` var x = "10";

var y = 20;

// Using parseInt for explicit coercion
var result = parseInt(x) + y;

console.log(result); // 30 `

In this example, the string "10" is explicitly coerced to a number using parseInt before performing the addition operation.

### Implicit Type Coercion:
This occurs when JavaScript automatically converts one data type to another during operations. This can sometimes lead to unexpected results.

`For example:`

var x = "10";

var y = 20;

// Implicit coercion during addition

var result = x + y;

console.log(result); // "1020"


<p>In this case, JavaScript implicitly converts the number y to a string and performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition.</p>
<p>The rules for implicit type coercion can vary depending on the operation. </p>

For example, the + operator performs concatenation if at least one of the operands is a string.

Here are some common scenarios of implicit coercion:

`console.log("5" + 2);      // "52" (string concatenation)`

`console.log("5" - 2);      // 3 (numeric subtraction)`

`console.log("5" * "2");    // 10 (numeric multiplication)`

`console.log("5" == 5);     // true (loose equality check with coercion)`

## Give an example of an unexpected result due to type coercion.

Certainly! One common source of unexpected results due to type coercion in JavaScript is the use of the + operator for concatenating strings.

`Here's an example:`

var x = "5";

var y = 10 ;

var result = x + y;

console.log(result); // "510"`

`In this example`, 
- The variable `x` is a string containing the character "5,"
- The variable `y` is a number with a value of `10`. 
- When the `+` operator is used, JavaScript performs implicit type coercion, converting the number `y` to a string and concatenating it with the string `x`. 
- As a result, the output is the string "510" instead of the expected numerical addition of `5 + 10`, which would be `15`.
  

To avoid such unexpected results, it's important to be mindful of the types of variables and explicitly coerce them when needed or use appropriate operators for the desired operation. For numerical addition in this case, you could convert the string to a number explicitly:

var x = "5";

var y = 10;

var result = Number(x) + y;

console.log(result); // 15

By explicitly converting `x` to a number using `Number(x)`, you ensure that the addition operation is performed numerically, and the result is `15`.
